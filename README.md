# Simple Todo App

Give a brief description of the project here. Feel free to give it a different name.

This project is an application for creating a todo list of tasks to complete. Users can name the task they want to add and add a date for when they wish to complete.

## Functionality

Give a more detailed explanation of the project and its functionality.

The user can add 'todo tasks' using the 'Add Todo' button in the upper right corner. They can name their tasks and assign a due date to them. Once they add their task and submit it, the input fields reset automatically. The submit button cannot be clicked until a name has been given to their task. The due date is optional. Users can check off their tasks with the checkbox button to mark completion.

This project was done using Object Oriented Programming (OOP). Data and program functionality is combined in objects. The FormValidator class includes methods and objects to encapsulate data in one entity, so as to be a convienient format that can also be built upon easily if needed in the future.
